## The Spirit of the Project

Representation on the internet matters. How you choose to represent your work can mean the difference between simply getting the interview, to landing the job. For every future layout that has a seamless user interface, cohesive layour with colors that invite but do not overwhelm; there are productions leading up that document your steps and process.

## Goal of the Project

This project is an introduction to applying the core skills I have learned and will continue to acquire throughout UW Coding Bootcamp. It is a space to practice new techniques and deploy the projects I will be completing during the course.

## Project Requirements

- Have a web layout with my name and recent photo, and links to work and contact information.
- Have a clickable link in the navigation that corresponds to each section.
- Projects have images with clickable links that are deployable; with first project being more prominant than the others.
- Have a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports.
